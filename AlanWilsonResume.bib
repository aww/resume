  abstract = {A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb−1 collected at s=7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb−1 at s=8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ, H→γγ and H→WW(⁎)→eνμν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H→ZZ(⁎), WW(⁎), bb¯ and τ+τ− in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ and H→γγ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0±0.4(stat)±0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7×10−9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.}

title = {A multivariate training technique with event reweighting},
journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {An event reweighting technique incorporated in multivariate training algorithms has been developed and tested with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Boosted Decision Trees (BDT).  The performance of the ANNs and BDTs resulting from this event reweighting training is compared to the performance from conventional equal event weighting training.  The comparison is performed in the context of physics analysis in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which will explore the fundamental nature of matter and the basic forces that shape our universe.  We demonstrate that the event reweighting technique provides an unbiased method of multivariate training for event pattern recognition.}
