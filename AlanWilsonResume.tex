\section{Experience}
\cventry{2014--present}{Fellow at Insight Data Science}{}{}{Mountain View, CA}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Developed the web app \href{http://NewsSpectra.com}{NewsSpectra.com} which presents alternative coverage of a topic
      on a spectrum of readability.
  \item Scraped and extracted information from Google News and individual sources with scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and goose. 
  \item Used Python tools nltk and scikit-learn to tokenize, cluster, and rank articles by Flesch-Kincaid reading level.
  \item Published application using AWS, MySQL, gunicorn, supervisor, Bootstrap, and D3.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2011--2013}{Post Doctoral Research Fellow}{ATLAS Experiment}{}{Geneva, Switzerland}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Filtered massive datasets (> 1 TB) to find very rare signals using local and world-wide batch computing,
    contributing to the discovery of the Higgs boson.
  \item Built C++ applications on top of the shared tools of a collaboration of 2000 scientists to calibrate, resolve ambiguities, and filter data.
  \item Developed a framework in Python and ROOT for specifying, building, and publishing plots to the web.
  \item Applied unit tests to publications by factoring out numerical quantities in JSON/YAML+Python.
  %\item Constructed event visualizations in various forms
  \item Controlled and monitored data acquisition, requiring quick reactions and efficient communication with colleagues.
  %\item Mentored graduate students, and was the primary editor for many documents including published papers.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2005--2010}{Graduate Student Research Assistant}{ATLAS \& D\O\ Experiments}{}{Michigan \& Illinois}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Used a large stack of Monte Carlo simulations (from particle production to detector response),
    as well as extrapolations from data, to quantify signal and background.
  \item Increased signal to background separation in selection and identification problems using boosted decision trees.
  \item Computed 95\% confidence intervals for new physical parameters using likelihoods built from data and
    statistical models of signal and background (with many nuisance parameters quantifying uncertainty).
  \item Managed Monte Carlo simulations by translating colleagues' informal requests into formal job specifications,
    testing and submitting the jobs, and monitoring the results; built tools in Python to streamline all of these steps. 
  \item Contributed 100+ pages to documents describing the experiment's sensitivity to new physics.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2004--2005}{Research Assistant}{ATLAS Experiment}{Univ. of Michigan}{Geneva, Switzerland}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Validated software by broadly and systematically comparing alternative systems for unexpected discrepancies;
    found and reported on important bugs.
  \item Led a team of five students to complete assembly and testing of large detector components.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{1999--2004}{Misc. Teaching}{}{}{}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Univ. of Michigan Math Dept.:
    taught Precalculus, Calculus I and Calculus II, and assisted with Differential Equations.
