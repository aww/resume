\section{Research \& Hardware Experience}
\cventry{2011--present}{Post Doctoral Research Fellow}{ATLAS Experiment}{CERN}{Geneva, Switzerland}{
  As part of the largest experiment in the world, I contributed to
  the Higgs discovery (specifically, via $H\rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4\ell$) and
  to measurements involving multiple leptons, including the rare decay $Z\rightarrow 4\ell$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Wrote readable, modular, and accurate analysis code to run in batch (Condor) and on the Grid
  %\item Mentored graduate students
  \item Developed many tools for efficiently specifying, building, and sharing plots
  \item Primary editor for at least one paper as well as internal documents
  \item Developed a framework for defining ``unit tests'' of numerical quantities in documents
  \item Constructed event visualizations in various forms
  \item Tested new detectors as part of a hardware installation team
  \item Controlled experiment-wide data acquisition when on shift, reacting quickly but thoughtfully to solve faults.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2009--2010}{Graduate Student Research Assistant}{D\O\ Experiment}{}{Batavia, Illinois}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Thesis topic: a search for new physics via the $Z(\rightarrow\ell\ell) \gamma$+missing $E_T$ final state.
    This is a niche topic, so I had the entire analysis largely to myself including
    \begin{itemize}
    \item exploring the theory and experimental sensitivity with simulation,
    \item estimating backgrounds with data-driven methods, and
    \item using statistics to quantify constraints on theory imposed by the observation.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Expert role managing Monte Carlo simulation jobs: responding to my colleagues requests
    and translating them into tested job specifications, submitting the jobs, and monitoring the results. 
  \item DAQ shifts: online control, monitoring, and problem solving for the data taking of a large experiment
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2005--2008}{Graduate Student Research Assistant}{ATLAS Experiment}{Univ. of Michigan}{Ann Arbor}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Primary contributor to large preparatory documents on (diboson) physics sensitivity before data was available.
  \item Wrote machinery for calculating confidence regions for coupling measurements.
  \item Working in a small team with an engineer and undergraduate I constructed
    the gas monitor chamber for the muon tracking system of ATLAS.
  \item Applied boosted decision trees to particle identification tasks (electron id. and b-tagging)
    becoming a local expert on the ATLAS software framework
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2004--2005}{Research Assistant}{ATLAS Experiment}{Univ. of Michigan}{Geneva, Switzerland}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Validated muon reconstruction software, presented systematic comparison of algorithms, and identified faults
  \item Commissioning of 40 large muon detectors, involving
    \begin{itemize}
    \item leading a team of five undergraduates to complete assembly and testing,
      % leak checking, commissioning with cosmic rays, and working out repairs on the fly
    \item managing logistics of the lab space when our supervisor was away, and
    \item training to operate cranes and becoming an expert in the gas mixing and distribution system.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{1994--1999}{Research Assistant}{Space Sciences, Geophysics}{Univ. of Washington}{Seattle}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{Built testing platforms for DAQ hardware and software used on balloon and satellite experiments.}
  \item{Literature summaries and simulations of coded aperture imaging using X-rays.}
  \end{itemize}
}
