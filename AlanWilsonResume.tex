\cventry{2014}{Fellow}{Insight Data Science}{}{Mountain View, CA}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Developed the web app \href{http://NewsSpectra.com}{NewsSpectra.com}
    which presents alternative news coverage of a topic on a spectrum of readability \& detail.
  \item Full stack web dev. from Web scraping, NLP processing, and web app deployment with MySQL, AWS, Bootstrap, D3, etc.
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2011--2013}{Post Doctoral Research Fellow}{ATLAS Experiment}{}{Geneva, Switzerland}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Contributing to supersymmetry searches and the discovery of the Higgs boson
  \item Filtered massive datasets (> 1 TB) to find very rare signals using local and world-wide batch computing,
  \item Built C++ applications on top of the shared tools of a collaboration of 2000 scientists to calibrate, resolve ambiguities, and filter data.
  \item Developed a framework in Python and ROOT for specifying, building, and publishing plots to the web.
  \item Applied unit tests to publications by factoring out numerical quantities in JSON/YAML+Python.
  %\item Constructed event visualizations in various forms
  \item Controlled and monitored data acquisition, requiring quick reactions and efficient communication with colleagues.
  %\item Mentored graduate students, and was the primary editor for many documents including published papers.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2005--2010}{Graduate Student Research Assistant}{ATLAS \& D\O\ Experiments}{}{Michigan \& Illinois}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Used a large stack of Monte Carlo simulations (from particle production to detector response),
    as well as extrapolations from data, to quantify signal and background.
  \item Increased signal to background separation in selection and identification problems using boosted decision trees.
  \item Computed 95\% confidence intervals for new physical parameters using likelihoods built from data and
    statistical models of signal and background (with many nuisance parameters quantifying uncertainty).
  \item Managed Monte Carlo simulations by translating colleagues' informal requests into formal job specifications,
    testing and submitting the jobs, and monitoring the results; built tools in Python to streamline all of these steps. 
  \item Contributed 100+ pages to documents describing the experiment's sensitivity to new physics.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2004--2005}{Research Assistant}{ATLAS Experiment}{Univ. of Michigan}{Geneva, Switzerland}{

    found and reported on important bugs.
  \item Led a team of five students to complete assembly and testing of large detector components.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{1994--2004}{Misc. research and teaching}{U. of Washington \& U. of Michigan}{}{Seattle \& Ann Arbor}{
